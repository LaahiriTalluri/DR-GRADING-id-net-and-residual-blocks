Integrating IDNet and Residual Blocks for Efficient Diabetic Retinopathy Grading
Project Overview
This project introduces a novel approach to diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using advanced deep learning models, specifically Inception-Deconvolutional (IDNet) and Residual networks (ResNet). Diabetic Retinopathy is a significant ocular condition linked to diabetes mellitus, necessitating early detection for effective intervention. This project aims to automate the grading process, improving accuracy and reducing the resource intensity of manual diagnoses.

Project Description
The project integrates IDNet and Residual Blocks to efficiently grade Diabetic Retinopathy from fundus images. Key components include:

IDNet: For extracting multi-scale features.
Residual Blocks: For improved gradient flow and feature learning.
Deconvolutional Layers: For upsampling and feature refinement.
The model leverages fundamental data augmentation techniques and advanced preprocessing methods to ensure robustness and accuracy in DR diagnosis.

Architecture
The architecture combines Inception modules, deconvolutional layers, and residual networks:

Inception Modules: Extract multi-scale features from retinal images.
Residual Blocks: Alleviate vanishing gradient problems and enhance training stability.
Deconvolutional Layers: Restore spatial details lost during downsampling.

Data Preparation
The dataset comprises fundus images sourced from Messidor, Messidor-2, DRISHTI-GS, and GitHub. Images are classified into stages of Diabetic Retinopathy:

Grade 0: No DR
Grade 1: Mild DR
Grade 2: Moderate DR
Grade 3: Severe DR
Grade 4: Proliferative DR
Data preparation involved normalization, noise reduction, and manual annotation by expert ophthalmologists. Data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance model generalization.

Pre-Processing
Preprocessing steps include:

Contrast Enhancement: Using CLAHE for improved visibility of critical areas.
Illumination Correction: To normalize lighting conditions.
Image Segmentation: For accurate object detection.
Data Augmentation: Techniques such as flipping and rotation to boost training data.
